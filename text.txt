MAZE GENERATION:
mazetree() board=[(0,0,x), (0,1,x), (0,2,x)....(49,47,x), (49,48,x), (49,49,x)] 2500 elements
x:0 or 1. 0 not travellable, 1 travellable.
once a block is set to 1, it cannot be changed back during generation.
each block now 1 will choose one of its verticle or horizontal neighbours and not diagonal neighbours.
two diagonal blocks cannot be 1.
start to end is first generation.
once the start to end is set, it will go back randomly to state 1 block and start one a new bad path.
the end of a path will never connect to a already state 1 block.
choice of movement: u:y-=1, d:y+=1, r:x+=1, l:x-=1
