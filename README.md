# Dungeon Maze Game

## Overview
The Maze Game is an interactive puzzle game created with Python and the Pygame library. In the game, you navigate through a randomly generated maze as a knight, avoiding enemies and trying to reach the exit. The maze layout is dynamically created, providing a new experience each time you play. Players can control the knight using the arrow keys, while enemies attempt to chase the player.

## Features
- **Randomized Maze Generation**: The game uses a custom maze generation algorithm to create a unique maze layout every time you play.
- **Player Movement**: Control the knight character using arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to move through the maze.
- **Enemies**: Multiple enemies are placed in the maze, which follow the player's movements and attempt to catch them.
- **Exit Objective**: The goal is to reach the exit, marked by a special tile on the maze.
- **Dynamic Gameplay**: With each new game, the maze layout and enemy positions change, keeping the experience fresh.
